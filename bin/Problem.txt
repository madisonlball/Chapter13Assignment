A university has the following dormitories:


Allen Hall: $1,800 per semester
Pike Hall: $2,200 per semester
Farthing Hall: $2,800 per semester
University Suites: $3,000 per semester


The university also offers the following meal plans:


7 meals per week: $600 per semester
14 meals per week: $1,100 per semester
Unlimited meals: $1,800 per semester


Create an application with two ComboBox controls. One should hold the names of the dormitories, and the other should hold the meal plans. The user should select a dormitory and a meal plan, and the application should show the total charges for the semester.
